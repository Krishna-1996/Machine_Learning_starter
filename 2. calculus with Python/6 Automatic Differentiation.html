          These are mathematical equations used to find the derivative of a
          function. Derivatives tell us how a function is changing at any given
          point. Differentiation equations provide a systematic way to find
          these derivatives.

        <b>Differentiation Notation:</b>
        <p>
          Differentiation notation refers to the symbols and expressions used to
          represent derivatives. Common notations include f(x),df/dx, or dy/dx,
          which represent the derivative of a function f(x) with respect to x.

        <b>The Power Rule:</b>
        <p>
          The power rule is a formula used to find the derivative of a function
          raised to a constant power. It states that if you have a function of
          the form f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f(x)
          is n *x^(n-1).

        <b>The Constant Multiple Rule:</b>
        <p>
          The constant multiple rule states that when you have a constant
          multiplied by a function, to find the derivative, you can simply take
          the derivative of the function and multiply it by the constant.
