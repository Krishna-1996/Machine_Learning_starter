'''
In derivative if there is any constant denoted as 'c' then it is consider as null 
d/dx (25) = 0: Here 25 is contant and its value is nul for being in derivative
'''
# 1. The Power Rule for Derivatives
'''
d/dx (x^n) = nx^n-1
Eg: d/dx (x^4) = 4x^3

'''
# 2. The constant Rule for Derivatives
'''
d/dx (c y) = c d/dx(y) = c dy/dx

Eg: y = x^4
dy/dx =  4x^3
d/dx 2y = 2(dy/dx) = 2(4x^3)= 8x^3

'''
# 3. The Sum Rule for Derivatives
'''
d(y+w)/dx = dy/dx +dw/dx
Eg: y = x^4, w = x^9
d(y+w)/dx = dy/dx +dw/dx
=> d/dx(x^4) + d/dx(x^9)
=> 4x^3 + 9x^8
