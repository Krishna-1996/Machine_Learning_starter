'''
In derivative if there is any constant denoted as 'c' then it is consider as null 
d/dx (25) = 0: Here 25 is contant and its value is nul for being in derivative

# 1. The Power Rule for Derivatives
'''
d/dx (x^n) = nx^n-1
Eg: d/dx (x^4) = 4x^3

'''
# 2. The constant Rule for Derivatives
'''
d/dx (c y) = c d/dx(y) = c dy/dx

Eg: y = x^4
dy/dx =  4x^3
d/dx 2y = 2(dy/dx) = 2(4x^3)= 8x^3

'''
# 3. The Sum Rule for Derivatives
'''
d(y+w)/dx = dy/dx +dw/dx
Eg: y = x^4, w = x^9
d(y+w)/dx = dy/dx +dw/dx
=> d/dx(x^4) + d/dx(x^9)
=> 4x^3 + 9x^8

# 4. The Product Rule for Derivatives
'''
d/dx(wz) = w(dz/dx) + z(dw/dx)
Eg: y = (6x^3)(7x^4)
=> w = 6x^3 ; z = 7x^4
=> dw/dx = 6*(3x^2) ; dz/dx = 7*(4x^3)
=> dw/dx = 18(x^2) ; dz/dx = 28(x^3)

=> d(wz/wx) = (w(dz/dx) + z(dw/dx))/z^2
=> d(wz/wx) = 6x^3(28(x^3)) + 7x^4(18(x^2))
=> d(wz/wx) = 168x^6 + 126x^6
=> d(wz/wx) = 294x^6
'''

# 5. The Quotient Rule for Derivatives
'''
d/dx((w/z)) = {z(dw/dx) -  w(dz/dx)}/z^2
Eg: y = (4x^2)(x^3 + 1)
