#6_3_1 Exercise 1: Regression in PyTorch
'''
1. Use PyTorch (or TensorFlow, if you like) to find the slope of y=x^{2}+2x+2 where x=2
2. Use the Regression in PyTorch notebook to simulate a new linear relationship between y and x, and then fit the parameters m and b.
'''

#Solution:
#Import libraries:
import torch
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Value of  x and y:
x = 2
