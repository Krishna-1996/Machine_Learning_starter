    <h1>Derivatives and Differentiation</h1>
    <h3><b>Includes the following topics:</b></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Delta Method:</b>
        <p>
          The Delta Method is a technique used in statistics to approximate the
          distribution of a function of random variables. It's often used when
          you have a sequence of random variables and you want to understand the
          behavior of their mean or variance.
        </p>
      </li>

        <b>The Differentiation Equations:</b>
        <p>
          These are mathematical equations used to find the derivative of a
          function. Derivatives tell us how a function is changing at any given
          point. Differentiation equations provide a systematic way to find
          these derivatives.

        <b>Differentiation Notation:</b>
        <p>
          Differentiation notation refers to the symbols and expressions used to
          represent derivatives. Common notations include f(x),df/dx, or dy/dx,
          which represent the derivative of a function f(x) with respect to x.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>The Power Rule:</b>
        <p>
          The power rule is a formula used to find the derivative of a function
          raised to a constant power. It states that if you have a function of
          the form f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f(x)
          is n *x^(n-1).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>The Constant Multiple Rule:</b>
        <p>
          The constant multiple rule states that when you have a constant
          multiplied by a function, to find the derivative, you can simply take
          the derivative of the function and multiply it by the constant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>The Sum Rule:</b>
        <p>
          The sum rule states that when you have a sum of two functions, the
          derivative of the sum is equal to the sum of the derivatives of the
          individual functions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>The Chain Rule:</b>
        <p>
          The chain rule is a rule used to find the derivative of a composite
          function. It states that if you have a function composed of two or
          more functions, you can find its derivative by taking the derivative
          of the outer function and multiplying it by the derivative of the
          inner function.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>The Product Rule:</b>
        <p>
          The product rule is a formula used to find the derivative of the
          product of two functions. It states that the derivative of the product
          of two functions is equal to the derivative of the first function
          times the second function, plus the first function times the
          derivative of the second function.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>The Quotient Rule:</b>
        <p>
          The quotient rule is a formula used to find the derivative of the
          quotient of two functions. It states that the derivative of the
          quotient of two functions is equal to the derivative of the numerator
          times the denominator, minus the numerator times the derivative of the
          denominator, all divided by the square of the denominator.
