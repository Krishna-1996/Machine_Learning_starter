In a Master's in Computer Modeling program, the subject "Methods of Non-linear Modeling" would likely focus on advanced techniques and algorithms for modeling complex, non-linear relationships between variables. Here's an overview of what you might expect to learn in such a course:

Subject Name: Methods of Non-linear Modeling
Overview:
Methods of Non-linear Modeling is a subject that explores various mathematical and computational techniques for modeling non-linear relationships and phenomena. It covers both parametric and non-parametric methods for modeling complex systems where linear models are insufficient or inadequate.

Key Topics Covered:
Introduction to Non-linear Modeling: Overview of non-linear modeling concepts, challenges, and applications in different domains, including engineering, economics, biology, and social sciences.

Non-linear Regression Analysis: Study of non-linear regression models and estimation techniques for fitting non-linear functions to empirical data. Includes methods such as least squares estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, and non-linear least squares.

Generalized Additive Models (GAMs): Introduction to GAMs, which generalize linear models by allowing non-linear relationships between predictors and the response variable. Focus on smooth functions and spline regression techniques.

Kernel Methods: Understanding kernel-based techniques for non-linear modeling, including kernel regression, kernel density estimation, and support vector machines (SVMs). Application of Mercer's theorem and kernel trick.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Overview of neural network architectures, training algorithms (e.g., backpropagation), and activation functions. Study of feedforward networks, recurrent networks, and deep learning models for non-linear modeling.

Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods: Introduction to decision tree algorithms (e.g., CART, C4.5) and ensemble methods (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) for non-linear regression and classification tasks.

Non-parametric Regression Techniques: Exploration of non-parametric regression methods such as locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS), kernel regression, and spline smoothing techniques (e.g., penalized splines, smoothing splines).

Model Selection and Validation: Techniques for model selection, evaluation, and validation in non-linear modeling. Includes cross-validation, bootstrap methods, information criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC), and diagnostic checks for assessing model fit and performance.
